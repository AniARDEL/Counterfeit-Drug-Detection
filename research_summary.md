# Counterfeit Drug Detection Exploration
## Image Recognition Techniques
1. **Single Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD)**
   - Used for detecting objects in images
   - Discretizes output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes
   - Generates scores for presence of each object category in each box
   - Produces adjustments to better match object shape
   - Can detect medicine name, logo, and composition

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Effective for analyzing visual imagery
   - Can be trained to recognize packaging features, logos, fonts, color schemes
   - Can detect subtle differences between authentic and counterfeit packaging

3. **Physical Detection Methods**
   - Videometer: Checks color spectrum in both infrared and ultraviolet
   - Raman Spectrometer: Uses laser to detect unique spectral signature of compounds
   - Infrared Spectroscopy: Analyzes molecular composition
   - Powder X-Ray Diffraction: Identifies inactive components and confirms presence/absence of active ingredients

## Text-Based Verification Techniques
1. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
   - Azure OCR has two components: text detection and text recognition
   - Can extract printed text from medicine packaging
   - Converts text into machine-readable form for verification

2. **Barcode/QR Code Verification**
   - Simple process to identify fake drugs through duplicate code detection
   - Easily scalable without infrastructure dependencies
   - Limitations: requires scanning operations, tags can be replicated, edible barcoding is difficult to deploy

3. **RFID Technology**
   - Good for securing packages in storage
   - Automated scanning with fixed readers minimizes human error
   - Limitations: requires heavy infrastructure, doesn't work well in transit, high cost per tag

4. **Blockchain**
   - Provides unified solution for traceability
   - Enhances data security and integrity
   - Creates tamper-proof digital audit trails
   - Limitations: lacks automated data capture, not feasible for small enterprises

5. **Combined Approach: IoT + AI + RPA + Blockchain**
   - Provides automated data capture
   - Creates tamper-proof system
   - Enables end-to-end traceability

## Database
- Cloud storage for authentic medicine database
- Verification of medicine name, composition, and packaging features
- Comparison of extracted text with database records

## System Workflow
1. Image input of medicine packaging
2. Object detection to identify logo, text, and other packaging features
3. Text extraction using OCR
4. Database verification of extracted information
5. Decision making: authentic vs. counterfeit

## Datasets
- Web scraping using tools like Scrapy and Selenium
- Equal number of real and fake images
- Self-annotation using labeling tools
- Data augmentation to balance datasets

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Testing with diverse drug samples
