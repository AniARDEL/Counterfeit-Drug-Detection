# Counterfeit Drug Detection System Architecture

## System Overview

The counterfeit drug detection system is designed to analyze pharmaceutical products using a combination of image recognition and text-based verification techniques. The system will identify potential counterfeit drugs by examining packaging features, verifying barcodes/serial numbers against a database, and analyzing visual characteristics.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Input Module
- **Image Acquisition**: Captures high-resolution images of drug packaging from multiple angles
- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes images, removes noise, and enhances features for better detection
- **Input Validation**: Ensures image quality meets minimum requirements for analysis

### 2. Image Recognition Module
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies key visual elements (logos, holograms, color schemes, fonts)
- **CNN-Based Classification**: Uses deep learning to classify authentic vs. counterfeit packaging
- **Single Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD)**: Locates and identifies specific regions of interest on packaging
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies visual inconsistencies compared to authentic packaging

### 3. Text Verification Module
- **OCR Engine**: Extracts text from packaging using Azure OCR or similar technology
- **Barcode/QR Code Scanner**: Reads and decodes product identification codes
- **Serial Number Extraction**: Isolates unique identifiers from packaging
- **Text Normalization**: Standardizes extracted text for database comparison

### 4. Database Module
- **Authentic Product Database**: Stores information about legitimate pharmaceutical products
- **Reference Image Repository**: Contains images of authentic packaging for comparison
- **Verification API**: Provides interfaces for checking product authenticity
- **Blockchain Integration**: Optional secure ledger for tracking verification history

### 5. Analysis Engine
- **Rule-Based Verification**: Applies predefined rules to check product authenticity
- **Machine Learning Classifier**: Combines multiple features to make final authenticity determination
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides probability assessment of product authenticity
- **Decision Logic**: Determines final verdict based on combined evidence

### 6. User Interface
- **Mobile Application**: Allows users to scan and verify medications
- **Web Dashboard**: Provides detailed analysis results and statistics
- **Alert System**: Notifies users and authorities about potential counterfeits
- **Result Visualization**: Displays detection results with highlighted suspicious areas

## Data Flow

1. User captures image of drug packaging through mobile app or uploads via web interface
2. System preprocesses the image to enhance quality and normalize features
3. Image recognition module analyzes visual characteristics of packaging
4. Text verification module extracts and processes text/barcode information
5. Extracted data is verified against the authentic product database
6. Analysis engine combines results from all modules to determine authenticity
7. System generates detailed report with confidence score and supporting evidence
8. User receives verification result with appropriate recommendations
