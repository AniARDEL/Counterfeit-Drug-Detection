Problem Statement
Addressing the Threat of Counterfeit Medicines in the Pharmaceutical Industry
The increasing number of counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical supply chain poses significant health risks. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10% of medical products in low- and middle-income countries are either substandard or falsified. Counterfeit medicines not only compromise patient safety but also contribute to treatment failures, drug resistance, and fatalities, significantly impacting global healthcare systems. These counterfeit drugs often contain incorrect doses of active ingredients or harmful substances, leading to severe medical complications and loss of life.
Counterfeit drug trade is a multi-billion-dollar industry that threatens both public health and the reputation of pharmaceutical companies. Traditional methods of detecting counterfeit drugs, such as manual inspection and verification through packaging labels, are insufficient due to the increasing sophistication of counterfeiters. The lack of an automated and scalable solution makes it difficult for consumers, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies to identify counterfeit medicines effectively.

Objective of the Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based counterfeit drug detection system using a combination of image recognition and text-based verification techniques. By leveraging deep learning and artificial intelligence, the model will analyze multiple factors, including:
⦁	Drug packaging features (logos, fonts, color schemes, and holograms)
⦁	Barcodes and serial numbers for verification against a database of authentic medicines
⦁	Chemical composition analysis (if applicable) to compare active ingredients
Impact of the Solution
By addressing this issue, our project will:
⦁	Significantly reduce health hazards by preventing the consumption of counterfeit drugs
⦁	Ensure medication safety through a reliable and efficient verification mechanism
⦁	Enhance trust in the pharmaceutical industry by providing transparency and accountability
⦁	Support regulatory bodies and pharmaceutical companies in tracking and eliminating counterfeit drugs from the market
The successful implementation of this project will help regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, and consumers quickly identify counterfeit drugs and take necessary actions. This system has the potential to revolutionize drug authentication, offering a scalable and accessible solution to one of the biggest challenges in global healthcare today.

Plan
The development of the counterfeit drug detection system will follow a structured plan:
Phase 1: Research & Data Collection
⦁	Conduct a thorough literature review on counterfeit medicine detection techniques.
⦁	Source datasets from public repositories, pharmaceutical companies, and online sources.
⦁	Identify data collection challenges and apply data augmentation to balance datasets.
Phase 2: Model Development
⦁	Preprocess collected datasets by removing noise and standardizing formats.
⦁	Train multiple deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, and transformers) for image and text analysis.
⦁	Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
